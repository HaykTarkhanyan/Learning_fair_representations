LOSSES
L_x - scalar, ensures new representation to retain as much info as possible
      (sum of squared differences) -> corresponding hyperparamanters A_x
L_y - scalar, ensures good classification 
      (mean log loss) -> corresponding hyperparamanters A_y
L_z - scalar, ensures statistical parity
      (sum of absolute differences) -> corresponding hyperparamanters A_z
