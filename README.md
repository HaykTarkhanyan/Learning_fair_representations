Learning fair representations is a pre-processing technique that finds a
latent representation which encodes the data well but obfuscates information
about protected attributes

Paper: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/zemel13.html

My implementation most importantly **contains docstring** and comments, and is **vectoried**(others had awful for loops)

There are 2 implementations on which this code is based on.
<ol>
<li>https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/blob/master/aif360/algorithms/preprocessing/lfr.py</li>
<li>https://github.com/zjelveh/learning-fair-representations</li>
</ol>

I tried to write implementation that would be easy to understand cause implemetations above where quite bad to be honest. Feel free to open issues if you need any help. 

Best of luck, 
Hayk
